### Summary
- The only disanvatage I found in refactoring the code was that it opened the door to bugs and issues with eh the code. However, once these issues were identified and addressed the refractored code proved to be more efficent and significatly reduced the time to run the report. Overall, the benefits of refactoring the code far outweighs the issues that may have occred during the process
